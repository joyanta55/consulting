Pictching ideas:
- Trade-off between infra cost vs maintaince cost ( human resource cost)
- An AI chatBot for the user:
    * With recommendation system for online users
- Secure data storage and managemnt ( usage of both on-premise and cloud resources)
    * Access control of data storage and resources
- AI-assisted product managment (Enhanced business related statistics):
    * Retail and inventory forecasting: Increase inventory turns, and improve in-stock availability by forecasting product demand at specific probability levels.
    * Workforce planning: Forecast workforce staffing at 15-minute increments to optimize for high and low demand periods.
    * Review summarizer: For example, A Glue product has comments "this glue is useful for fragile object","superb!water resistent","be careful, use gloves while using". Then the review summerize "This glue is useful for fragile object and at the same time water-resistent. But few customer warned about safety uses". In doing so, anyone can get a clear idea about the utility and limitations of the product.
