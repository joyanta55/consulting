Pictching ideas:
- Trade-off between infra cost vs maintaince cost ( human resource cost)
- An AI chatBot for the user:
    * With recommendation system for online users. For example, with proper AI uses in backend, you have 24*7 chatbot helpline users in finding related products. Keep in mind about infra cost here. If you want detailed control like GenAI provides, it will cost much more than a basic chatbot that only answers limited questions (by basic, I meant NLP based chatbot, check AWS Lex).
- Secure data storage and managemnt ( usage of both on-premise and cloud resources)
    * Access control of data storage and resources. For example, you likely want to prevent unauthorized access to sales information. If any changes are needed, you should review and approve the request before the modification.
- AI-assisted product managment (Enhanced business related statistics):
    * Retail and inventory forecasting: Increase inventory turns, and improve in-stock availability by forecasting product demand at specific probability levels. For example, there is a 90% chance that a specific product will drop its appeal to the users in the coming month. This would be calculated based on many factors like chat descriptions, user comments, product sale pattern, any many other hidden patterns. (check AWS forecast)
    * Workforce planning: Forecast workforce staffing at 15-minute increments to optimize for high and low demand periods.
    * Review summarizer: For example, A Glue product has comments "this glue is useful for fragile object","superb!water resistent","be careful, use gloves while using". Then the summerizer would summarize these comments as "This glue is useful for fragile object and at the same time water-resistent. But few customer warned about safety uses". In doing so, anyone can get a clear idea about the utility and limitations of the product. (check hugging face open source, no cost per access.)
    * Dig out user's unknown interests: You know what your user buys or likes, but you donâ€™t know what else they might want beyond that list. Using AI/ML, you can figure that out. ML will analyze other similar users' preference list and recommend few other products, the intended user might like. Shoot him/her a promotion offer if your inventory have that product. [common ML concept]
