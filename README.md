Pictching ideas:
- Trade-off between infra cost vs maintaince cost ( human resource cost)
- An AI chatBot for the user:
    * With recommendation system for online users. For example, with proper AI uses in backend, you have 24*7 chatbot helpline users in finding related products. Keep in mind about infra cost here. 
- Secure data storage and managemnt ( usage of both on-premise and cloud resources)
    * Access control of data storage and resources
- AI-assisted product managment (Enhanced business related statistics):
    * Retail and inventory forecasting: Increase inventory turns, and improve in-stock availability by forecasting product demand at specific probability levels. For example, there is a 90% chance that a specific product will lose its appeal to the users. This would be calculated based on many factors like chat descriptions, user comments, product sale pattern, any many other hidden patterns.
    * Workforce planning: Forecast workforce staffing at 15-minute increments to optimize for high and low demand periods.
    * Review summarizer: For example, A Glue product has comments "this glue is useful for fragile object","superb!water resistent","be careful, use gloves while using". Then the review summerize "This glue is useful for fragile object and at the same time water-resistent. But few customer warned about safety uses". In doing so, anyone can get a clear idea about the utility and limitations of the product.
