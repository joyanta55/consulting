## A template for beginners. 
A grpc based shared queue. Grpc server uses the host memory for maintaining a queue, and different grpc client can poll/exchange information from the queue.

## Run grpc server.
```
bazel run //src:server
```
This would listen to port 50051 for incoming requests.

Pictching ideas:
* Trade-off between infra cost vs maintaince cost ( human resource cost)
- An AI chatBot for the user:
    * With recommendation system for online users
- Secure data storage and managemnt ( usage of both on-premise and cloud resources)
    * Access control of data storage and resources
- AI-assisted product managment:
    * Retail and inventory forecasting: Reduce waste, increase inventory turns, and improve in-stock availability by forecasting product demand at specific probability levels.
    * Workforce planning: Forecast workforce staffing at 15-minute increments to optimize for high and low demand periods
